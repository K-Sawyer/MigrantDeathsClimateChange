# **Crises Collide:** is there a correlation between rising temperatures and migrant deaths in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona?
## **_Katie Sawyer_**

**â†’** In this notebook, I will be comparing the number of migrant deaths on the Southern Arizona border with the increase in average monthly temperatures in the area due to climate change. I will be using climate data taken from the National Centers for Environmental Information operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) at their Ajo, Arizona substation from 2010 to 2022, and an open database by Humane Borders mapping migrant deaths. I will need to rename columns to match the data, remove unnecessary data and columns, and isolate variables to get the comparison I am looking for. 

### _The goal of this project is to inform readers of this issue through visualizations of data in my article. In tandem, I hope to find support for my hypothesis: that increased temperatures in the Sonoran Desert due to climate change correlate with the number of migrant deaths due to exposure._
